## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User accounts/login | PROJECT.md: Keep local, no sync complexity for v1 |
| Social features (sharing, leaderboards) | PROJECT.md: Avoid social comparison, focus on solo experience |
| Built-in content library/store | Content licensing complexity, storage bloat |
| Traditional scrolling reading mode | Dilutes RSVP core value, maintenance burden |
| TTS/audio narration | Conflicts with visual RSVP focus, separate use case |
| AI summarization | API costs, unreliable quality, scope creep |
| Gamification (badges, streaks) | Creates obligation vs enjoyment |
| Multiple reading modes beyond RSVP | Do one thing well, avoid feature bloat |
