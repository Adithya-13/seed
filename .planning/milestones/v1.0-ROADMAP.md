# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 11

## Overview

Four-phase journey from core RSVP engine to feature-complete App Store release. Phase 1 establishes smooth timing and display (critical foundation). Phase 2 adds input variety (URL/PDF). Phase 3 polishes UX and ensures App Store compliance. Phase 4 adds retention features (stats, comprehension tracking).

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation + RSVP Engine

**Goal**: Smooth RSVP playback with smart anchoring and basic controls
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: RSVP-01, RSVP-02, RSVP-03, RSVP-04, RSVP-05, RSVP-06, RSVP-07, RSVP-08, RSVP-09, RSVP-10, INPUT-01
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User can paste text and see it displayed word-by-word with smart anchoring (bold first letters)
  2. User can control playback (play/pause/seek) and adjust WPM in real-time
  3. Playback is smooth with dynamic word timing and automatic slowdown at punctuation
  4. User sees reading progress indicator (current word / total words)

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Foundation RSVP Engine (CADisplayLink, smart anchoring, dynamic timing)
- [x] 01-02: UI Layer (RSVPViewModel, display view, playback controls)
- [x] 01-03: Text Input (clipboard paste, validation, input → playback flow)

**Completed:** 2026-01-18

### Phase 2: Text Input Sources

**Goal**: Multiple text import methods (paste, URL, PDF)
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: INPUT-02, INPUT-03, INPUT-04
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User can import article from URL with clean text extraction (no nav/ads)
  2. User can import PDF file with text extraction working correctly
  3. User can choose between paste/URL/PDF input methods from UI

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: URL Article Extraction (HTML stripping, URLSession)
- [x] 02-02: PDF Text Extraction (PDFKit integration)
- [x] 02-03: Multi-Source Input UI (segmented picker with three tabs)

**Completed:** 2026-01-19

### Phase 3: UX Polish + Accessibility

**Goal**: App Store ready with polished UX and accessibility compliance
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: UX-01, UX-02, UX-03, UX-04, UX-05, RSVP-11
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User can adjust font size (Dynamic Type support) and toggle light/dark theme
  2. New users see interactive onboarding that demonstrates RSVP vs normal reading
  3. App follows Apple HIG with eye-friendly color palette and native iOS patterns
  4. User can enable focus mode for fullscreen, distraction-free reading

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Settings Infrastructure (AppSettings with @AppStorage, font/theme/focus controls)
- [x] 03-02: Interactive Onboarding (live RSVP demo, multi-page flow)
- [x] 03-03: Focus Mode & Eye-Friendly Colors (warm palette, fullscreen mode, HIG compliance)

**Completed:** 2026-01-19

### Phase 4: Stats + Comprehension

**Goal**: Progress tracking and comprehension validation for retention
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: STATS-01, STATS-02, STATS-03, STATS-04
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User sees completion stats after each reading session (time, WPM, word count)
  2. User can view reading history dashboard with performance over time
  3. User can optionally take comprehension quiz after reading to validate retention

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Session Tracking + Stats (ReadingSession model, SessionStore, CompletionStatsView)
- [x] 04-02: History + Quiz (HistoryView with WPM chart, ComprehensionQuizView)

**Completed:** 2026-01-19

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- @Observable macro for state management (simpler syntax, modern SwiftUI)
- CADisplayLink for 60fps timing precision (vs Timer)
- Dynamic timing formula (+50% for 8+ chars, +100% for punctuation)
- AttributedString for smart anchoring visualization (bold font weight)
- Custom HTML stripping (ReadabilityKit archived, regex-based)
- @AppStorage JSON persistence for sessions (max 50, prevents UserDefaults bloat)
- SwiftUI Path for line charts (no external dependencies)
- Hardcoded quiz questions for v1 (auto-generation deferred to v2)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Smooth 60fps playback achieved with CADisplayLink + delta time accumulation
- Smart anchoring correctly handles word length variations (1-3 letters)
- Text input validation prevents edge cases (empty, too long, whitespace-only)
- Focus mode hides status bar, tap gesture for play/pause
- Session persistence handles up to 50 sessions efficiently

**Technical Debt:**
- Test target not configured (test files ready, infrastructure deferred)
- Quiz questions hardcoded (LLM-based generation deferred to v2)
- No iCloud sync (UserDefaults only, local-first for v1)
